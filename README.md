# DevSlopesProj-RampUp
iOS ARKit demo featuring live-sized skateboard ramps

Made for the iOS 11 development course from DevSlopes. 3D ramp assets provided by Mark Price.

Because this app uses a camera (AR apps need the camera), this will not run in the Simulator; you need a physical device to test.

Because ARKit was introduced in iOS 11, you need that version of the OS on your iDevices to run. Please take note that ARKit will only run on Apple A9 processors or newer, so the minimum iPhone required to run is an iPhone 6S/iPhone 6S Plus, or an iPhone SE. The minimum iPad required is the 5th gen iPad from early 2017 (any iPad Pro will work).
